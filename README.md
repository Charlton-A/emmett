weppy is a full-stack python framework that includes everything needed to easily create fast, scalable and secure web applications.

It's based on *web2py* and inspired by *Flask*.

## Examples

The "bloggy" example described in the [Tutorial](http://weppy.org/docs/latest/tutorial) is available under the *examples* folder. While we're still populating this folder with more examples, you can take a look also at [H-Funding](https://github.com/gi0baro/h-funding), which can give you a deepen view on weppy's features.

## Status of the project

weppy is currently released in beta stage.
*What does it means?*
